    <title>Project Proposal</title>
    <h2>Project name:</h2>
        <p>Nourish</p>
    
    <h2>Overview:</h2> 
	<p>I want to work on the redesign of the Nourish website. I think that getting more research on the users will make this website more user friendly. In addition to redesigning the website, I think making it responsive for mobile devices is important because many people use their phones more often than a laptop or desktop. I also want to add photos that I take myself to add to the website instead of using free stock photos. I think that adding photos that are more accurate to the targeted audience makes the website more authentic. I want to make the site very consistent with design as well. I think that color is very important when it comes to food related things. </p>

<h2>Audience:</h2> 
	<p>Anyone who relies on the Blue Ridge area Food Bank and has access to the internet. 
</p>

      <h2>Timeline: </h2>

        <li>User research - due 2/20</li>
        <li>Prototype and wireframes - due 2/23</li>
